# Apriori-Transection

## Introduction
This is a really simple project that implement "Apriori Algorithm". Apriori frequently used on finding the relationship between datas. <br/>

In this implementation, we got transections(you can check in transection.xlsx) which contain multiple items. I intend to find the frequent itemsets(If not sure what this term is please review the concept of Apriori~~~) by Apriori and calculate their probabilities, and write the result in result.xlsx file at last.

## Requirements
```
pip install pandas
pip install xlrd
pip install openpyxl
```

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/leochen66/Apriori-Transection
cd Apriori-Transection
